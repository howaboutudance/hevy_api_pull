### Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- `pip` for dependencies

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/howaboutudance/hevy_api_pull.git
cd hevy_api_pull
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Environment Setup

You‚Äôll need an API key from Hevy

This project uses `.env` files and dynaconf to manage setting/configuration.
To setup a new deployment.

1. Create a `.env` file to define the environment the code will run in (default is `DEV`)

    ```env
    ENV=DEV
    ```

2. Create a enviroment yaml file that matches your environment name (lowercase of the environment name with yaml extension). In this example `dev.yaml`
3. (Optional for live data pulling) Generate a HEVY API Key
4. Add the API key to `.secrets.yaml` and define the endpoint for the hevy api in your environment file
    - .secrets.yaml

    ```yaml
    hevy_api__key: <insert key here>
    ```

    - dev.yaml

    ```yaml
    hevy_api:
    url: "https://api.hevyapp.com"
    version: "v1"
    ```

5. configure the mongodb credentials in `.secrets.yaml` and your enviroment yaml (lowercase environment nameed yaml file in config folder)
    - .secrets.yaml

    ```yaml
    mongodb__password: <insert password here>
    ```

    - dev.yaml

    ```yaml
    # example for local development
    mongodb:
    username: admin
    host: "localhost:27017"
    ```
